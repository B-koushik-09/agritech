“Ma’am, our current model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains around 15 classes from three major crops — tomato, potato, and pepper.
However, the system is designed in a modular way, so we can easily extend it to other crops like cotton, maize, or rice by collecting and labeling new images and retraining the model.
This will make it a scalable AI platform for plant disease detection — not limited to just one crop".

“We selected tomato, potato, and pepper because these crops are commonly used in the PlantVillage dataset — which is publicly available, high-quality, and verified.
This allowed us to train a model with good accuracy while focusing on building the full AI pipeline, not just data collection.”

“Ma’am, right now our model is trained only on three plants — Tomato, Potato, and Pepper — because those were available in the PlantVillage dataset.
But we can easily add Cotton in the future. We just need to collect images of healthy and diseased cotton leaves, like ‘Cotton_healthy’ and ‘Cotton_bacterial_blight’, put them in new folders inside our dataset, and train the same model again.
The model will then learn to detect Cotton diseases too — we don’t have to build it again from scratch, just fine-tune the top layers. That’s called transfer learning.”
