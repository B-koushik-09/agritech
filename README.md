## ⚙️ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   Google Gemini API Key ([Get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/B-koushik-09/agritech.git
cd Agri_Tech

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (this file is ignored by Git for security):
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=any_random_string_for_sessions
```

### 4. Database Setup
The application uses SQLite. The `users.db` file will be generated automatically in the root directory on the first launch (Ignored in Git).

### 5. Launch
```bash
python app.py
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to start using the app.

## 🧠 Model Information
The system uses a **MobileNetV2** architecture fine-tuned on the **PlantVillage** dataset. It currently supports detection for:
*   **Tomato**: Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, etc.
*   **Potato**: Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy.
*   **Pepper**: Bacterial Spot, Healthy.
